# Smart Boiler Control
The Smart Boiler Control application illustrates, how touch interactivity concepts are brought into control panel with a modern/futuristic smart boiler control panel. The  Smart Boiler Control application was automatically generated from SCADE Suite® and SCADE Display®.
The Smart boiler controller is software used to control the water level in a steam boiler. It is important that the program works correctly because the quantity of water present when the steam boiler is operating must neither be too low nor too high; otherwise, the smart boiler  in front of it could be seriously affected.
