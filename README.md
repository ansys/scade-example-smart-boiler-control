# Smart Boiler Control
<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" title=""><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg" alt="MIT" /></a>

The Smart Boiler Control application illustrates, how touch interactivity concepts are brought into control panel with a modern/futuristic smart boiler control panel. The  Smart Boiler Control application was automatically generated from SCADE Suite® and SCADE Display®.
The Smart boiler controller is software used to control the water level in a steam boiler. It is important that the program works correctly because the quantity of water present when the steam boiler is operating must neither be too low nor too high; otherwise, the smart boiler  in front of it could be seriously affected.


This project serves as a companion to the blog series, "Designing a Next-Gen Embedded HMI," which explores the concepts implemented =>  [SCADE Smart Boiler Control – Designing a next-gen embedded HMI](https://ansyskm.ansys.com/forums/topic/scade-smart-boiler-control-designing-a-next-gen-embedded-hmi/).
